  - title: "Problem discovery"
    image: "/images/blog/problem-discovery.png"
    content: "<i>What are the biggest challenges your company is facing?</i> Engineers and architects are great at solving problems, but they don’t always question how those problems are defined. If you spend time solving the wrong problem, you waste time and resources. That’s why Continuous Architecture encourages you to pay close attention to how problems are framed — because the way you define a problem heavily shapes the solutions you find."
    bulletpoints:
      - "Sometimes, just looking at a problem differently can lead to completely new and better answers"
      - "Finding the real problem starts with careful observation and asking the right questions"
      - "It also takes an open mind to see things from new angles and think outside the box"

  - title: "Framework"
    image: "/images/framework.png"
    content: "The tools and kits we have created can be used in isolation or they can work together to help the enterprise change to be more successful. In a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex or Ambiguous world, it is important to bring structure while enabling business and operational agility. The Continuous Architecture Framework (CAF) combines intentional architecture and emergent design to help autonomous teams align around a common purpose. Team autonomy is a pre-requisite to speed because it reduces coordination activities that slow down teams. On the other hand, when autonomous teams are mis-aligned it increases the risk of delivering poor client and employee experience due to ineffective coordination. The CAF helps maintain a healthy balance between autonomy and alignment along the enterprise journey toward an agile @scale operating model."
    bulletpoints:
      - The equation we’re proposing is ALIGNMENT + AUTONOMY > CONTROL.
