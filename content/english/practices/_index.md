Developers have practices to help them do a better job. Things like Test Driven Development, design patterns etc. Why can't we propose some to architects? because if we don't how can we expect architects to do a better job? On this page, we propose some practices that we believe could be helpful for architects and that are aligned with the [Continuous Architecture Manifesto](../manifesto)

## Architecture Decision Records

[Architecture Decision Records](architecture-decision-records): architects take decision all the time and we need to keep track of them. This kit is about the decision making process we need to follow.

## Architecture Runway

[Architecture Runway](architecture-runway) aims to make sure the product backlog contains the intentional architecture items as well as the emerging design ones. Not only they appear in the backlog but they are also prioritized (like business features).

## Fitness Functions

[Fitness Functions](fitness-functions) monitor architectural characteristics of your products you want to protect over time.

## Scoping 360

[scoping 360](scoping-360) is a huge practice not only covering architecture aspects. It's a complete methodology to help assembling a team aligned on a vision and ready to deliver its products. And in the workshops sequence that compose the scoping 360 approach, we can find an architecture workshop.

## Team Topologies

[Team Topologies](team-topologies) directly coming from the [Team topologies](https://teamtopologies.com) book from M Pais & M Skelton, we have create a took (a Miro board) to help architecture influence the organization of teams delivery their product.

## Value Proposition Canvas

[Value Proposition Canvas](value-proposition-canvas): a tool used in product development to better understand and articulate the value a product offers to its target users.
