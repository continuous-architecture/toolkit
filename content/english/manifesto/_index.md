description: "This manifesto outlines the core beliefs and principles of Continuous Architecture — a modern, product-centric approach to architecture aligned with continuous delivery and sustainable evolution."

This Continuous Architecture Manifesto provides a clear set of beliefs and principles for our architectural operating model.
It is not an attempt to compete with other well-known manifestos (e.g. [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org), [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org)).
It reflects a shift from traditional waterfall approaches with big designs up front to a **continuous runway mindset**.

## Key Trends and Shifts

### Trends shaping customer and product experience

**Customers and users expect more**

* Customers prefer products and services that solve real problems and help them accomplish tasks.
* Most customers leave a company after a poor experience.
* Experience expectations are shaped by large technology companies.
* Customers increasingly prefer brands aligned with environmental and social values; organizations incorporate ESG goals for both compliance and attractiveness.

**Technology is a game changer**

* Cyber-physical systems make products smarter, more connected, personalized, and efficient.
* The integration of digital and physical worlds creates new possibilities for functionality, interaction, and service delivery.
* AI and LLMs enable personalized, efficient, and responsive customer experiences.

**Business models evolve**

* The shift to “as-a-service” impacts offerings (usage vs. ownership), revenue models, sales, and delivery.
* Business ecosystems emerge by combining capabilities from different sectors to offer services that no single company could provide alone.

### Trends shaping organizations

**Decision-making is less centralized**

* Teams closer to the problem and the customer make faster decisions without multiple approval layers, enabling quicker adaptation to market changes.
* Decentralization scales operations more effectively by distributing the decision-making load.

**Facts supported by data drive decisions**

* Data provides an unbiased view of reality, minimizing personal opinions, emotions, and biases.
* It helps detect shifts in market conditions, customer behavior, and the competitive landscape.
* Decision-making evolves from guesswork to a more scientific approach.

**Management practices influence performance**

* In many organizations, hierarchical management discourages initiative and reduces innovation capacity.
* Lack of autonomy and recognition reduces employee engagement, impacting both economic and social performance.
* Employees and employers alike demand improved management practices.

### Trends shaping software

**Rapid deployment of Software-Defined-X and X-as-Code**

* By shifting from hardware-centric to software-driven solutions, Software-Defined-X:

  * Enables organizations to adapt quickly to changing needs by abstracting hardware dependencies.
  * Reduces operational costs by automating routine tasks while improving resilience by minimizing human error.

**Software becomes a commodity**

* Low-code/no-code platforms democratize software creation, enabling faster innovation with fewer technical barriers.
* Agentic AI coding tools transform productivity and workflows; projections estimate that AI will generate 95% of code within 5 years (vs. 30% today).

**Platforms go mainstream**

* By separating stable components from differentiators, platforms provide economies of scale while accelerating innovation.
* Platforms with highly usable self-service features empower autonomous teams.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) are key**

* Security, safety, privacy, resilience, robustness, sustainability, and frugality become critical architectural drivers.
* Traceability of requirements ensures that architectural decisions align with business impact (e.g. SRE practices).

## We Deliver Superior Product Experience

* We adopt an **outside-in approach**, analyzing customer and stakeholder context to guide product design.
* We integrate **customer research** from sociology, anthropology, and marketing.
* We favor **automation with a human touch** to make products and services easier to use.
* We leverage **architecture for flow** to support continuous development and operations, shortening learning cycles through rapid feedback.
* We design **smart products** powered by AI and LLMs.
* We build **safe, secure, ESG-friendly, and antifragile products** that customers can trust.
* We ensure **efficient delivery and customer support processes** that meet stakeholder expectations.

---

## We Advocate a Socio-Technical Approach

* Continuous Architecture is recursive: **we build the socio-technical systems that build and operate the product system**.
* **Architecture sparks essential discussions and informs decisions** at both enterprise and product levels. Architects act as experts and coaches.
* We use **modularity** to eliminate avoidable inter-team dependencies, a powerful lever for autonomy.
* We promote the **symbiosis between humans and machines**: humans + AI outperform humans or machines alone. Full automation is not always the right solution.
* We foster a **learning organization** with mentoring practices and empowered teams.
* We apply Conway’s Law: by **structuring teams to reflect the desired architecture (inverse Conway maneuver)** we reduce handoffs and interfaces.
* We recognize that new technologies impact social balance. We favor the **co-evolution of social and technological systems**.

---

## We Engineer and Steer Complex Systems

* We prioritize **domain modeling and design** over rigid processes or trend-driven technology choices.
* We practice **rigorous requirements engineering**, linking non-functional objectives and metrics to business needs (e.g. SRE).
* We encourage **self-sovereign identity and smart contracts** to secure data exchange across ecosystems.
* We **extend product development** to include design of delivery and support processes. We validate architecture through rapid delivery and real-world feedback.
* We favor **leveling over layering**: modular decomposition guides system evolution. We standardize boundaries for reuse and composability.
* We embrace **platform thinking** to maximize reuse and autonomy.
* We design with a **holistic view**, recognizing the interdependence of business models, hardware, software, and services.
* We promote **concurrent engineering** over sequential processes.

## Our Principles

1. **Customer-centricity first**: outside-in design, grounded in research and empathy.
2. **Flow and feedback**: continuous delivery, automation, and rapid learning loops.
3. **Socio-technical balance**: systems evolve with both people and technology.
4. **Autonomy through modularity**: minimizing dependencies, maximizing empowerment.
5. **Resilience and responsibility**: designing for security, sustainability, and trust.
6. **Holistic systems thinking**: aligning business, technology, and human factors.

✨ *We invite practitioners, organizations, and communities to adopt, share, and evolve these principles with us to shape the future of Continuous Architecture.*
