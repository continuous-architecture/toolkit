    content: "When we decided to start this Continuous Architecture journey, we discovered that the term have been already coined by Murat Erder and Pierre Pureur. Back in 2015, they published their first book [Continuous Architecture: Sustainable Architecture in an Agile and Cloud-Centric World](https://www.amazon.fr/Continuous-Architecture-Sustainable-Agile-Cloud-Centric/dp/0128032847) and they are working on a second one [Continuous Architecture in Practice](https://continuousarchitecture.com/). We can say that Murat and Pierre through their work were a source of inspiration for us. We got in touch with them to make sure it was ok to reuse the Continuous Architecture term and they agreed. We’re very grateful to them and the least we could do is to reference their work. If you have a chance to have a look at it, you’ll see that we share many things: spirit, ideas, philosophy & experiences."

    content: "Several Continuous Architecture’s maintainers contributed to the development of the Open Agile ArchitectureTM Standard. Though the Continuous Architecture Toolkit and Framework was developed independently, we believe the two bodies of knowledge share many common principles and are therefore consistent and complementary."
