## Lean context

A "problem" is ... the gap between the way things are now and the way they're supposed to be, or you want them to be, in the future [^1].

## Framing/re-framing context

Before getting drawn into details, scouring a stated problem for clues while completely forgetting to challenge the overall framing can get you trapped by the initial framing of the problem. This is why you should consider two approaches when analyzing a problem [^2]:  

* Exploring the frame to understand the original problem statement
* Breaking the frame to challenge the initial framing of the problem
