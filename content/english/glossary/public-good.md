In economics, a public good refers to a commodity or service that is made available to all members of a society [^1].

A public good has two key characteristics which make it difficult for market producers to sell the good to individual consumers [^2].

* *Nonexcludable* means that it is costly or impossible for one user to exclude others from using a good
* *Nonrivalrous* means that when one person uses a good, it does not prevent others from using it.
