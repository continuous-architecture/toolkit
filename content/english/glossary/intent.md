Intention is a polysemous word. In a first sense "intention" designates an act of the will. In a second sense "intention" has the meaning of form, understood both as form and as definition. In a third sense "intention" has the meaning of concept; when the intellectee conceives the thing he forms in himself an intention of the conceived thing [^1].
