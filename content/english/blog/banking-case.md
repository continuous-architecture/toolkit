### Current offerings

#### UNI small business lending

The small business lending products are not at par with competition and are not tailored to meet specific customer segments’ needs.
They consume too much regulatory and economic capital:

* Poor management of impaired loans
* Credit products not designed to optimize capital consumption

The shortcomings of legacy systems and processes have a negative impact on the customer experience. The poor automation level combined with the rework generated by non-quality results into higher costs which contributes to degrade UNI's cost/income ratio.

### Operating model

Each brand is a legal entity that is fully owned by the RB Bank Group and manages its balance sheet and P&L. Financial and regulatory reporting is consolidated at the group level.

Each brand manages its own information system with minimum guidance from the group.

#### UNI operations

The UNI Operating Unit has adopted a classical retail banking organizational structure :

It is supported by an information system that is described in this figure :
