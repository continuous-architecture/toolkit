For more than 20 years, I have been supporting the challenges of digital transformation. My different experiences (digital strategic plan, deployment of "empowering" organizational models, management of enterprise architecture department, animation of inter-company workgroup at club URBA-EA , participation in associations on the management of the 21st century MOM 21) and my observations led me to found glue N'DO. At glue N'DO, we are convinced that an integral approach combining the development of the consciousness of people and organizations, deployment of collaborative models with special attention to the new fundamentals of the digital world ( end-user centricity, business and digital cycles, continuous architecture, data prime, open innovation) is key for sustainable growth. After being part of the construction and implementation of Continuous Architecture operating model and Toolbox within Michelin, consolidating the model, enriching the toolbox in an open approach of sharing and co-construction is a strong motivation.
