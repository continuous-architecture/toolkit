With over 20 years of experience in information systems, digital transformation, and product management, Célia Carceller Kemiche has worked in diverse organizations, from the public sector (France Travail, URSSAF, Ministry of Agriculture) to the private sector (Bouygues/Colas), covering a broad range of competencies from digital service design to managing complex IT transformations.  
At France Travail, she contributes to the evolution of the Platform IT system and architecture practices, aligning them with agile methods and the product-oriented approach. Her hybrid background—as both an architect and a product leader—enables her to connect strategic vision, operational pragmatism, and value-driven delivery, while fostering cross-functional collaboration and team engagement.  
Passionate about innovation and convinced of the power of collective effort, she advocates for a living, continuous architecture that bridges strategy and execution.
