This open-source project is supported by a volunteer-driven association founded in 2024.
It promotes Continuous Architecture — a collaborative and open approach to designing and evolving information systems.
Beyond technical contributions, the association hosts “pollination events” that bring together practitioners and enthusiasts to exchange ideas, share experiences, and spread best practices across the community.
The project also thrives thanks to the support of benefactor companies that help ensure its growth and long-term sustainability.
